# Predictive-Volatility-Optimization-Enhancing-Options-Pricing

The project, titled "Enhancing Volatility Prediction for Optimal Pricing," responds to the urgent demand for precise volatility forecasts in financial markets, particularly for a global electronic market maker operating across diverse asset classes. Volatility is a key factor influencing the pricing of options, ETFs, cash equities, bonds, and foreign currencies, and the project aims to refine predictive models to achieve fairer and more accurate options prices, benefiting both Financial Institutes and end investors.

The literature review underscores the importance of implied volatility (IV) in risk management and derivatives pricing, noting its forward-looking nature as a crucial element in explaining future volatility. Various IV estimation methods, including backwardation, time-series volatility models like GARCH, and artificial neural network models, are explored. While GARCH models dominate time-series volatility modeling, there's a debate on the use of Black-Scholes implied volatility, adding complexity to the literature. The study proposes investigating the performance of the underexplored Artificial Bee Colony-Back Propagation (ABC-BP) neural network model in IV predictability and its application to diverse option trading strategies.

This research aims to bridge a literature gap by evaluating the ABC-BP model's effectiveness in IV predictability and its applicability to various option trading strategies. The comprehensive framework of the study encompasses a thorough literature review, methodology, results, and implications, contributing valuable insights to the evolving field of volatility prediction.

**1. Project Initialization**

The project begins with the importation of necessary libraries, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. These libraries are essential for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization tasks.

**2. Data Acquisition**

The datasets for this project are obtained from parquet files, specifically focusing on the book and trade data related to `stock_id` 0. This involves reading the respective files and loading them into dataframes for further processing.

**3. Data Overview**

An initial exploration of the datasets is conducted by displaying the number of rows and columns and examining the first few rows of both the book and trade data. This step provides a preliminary understanding of the data structure and content.

**4. Dataset Information**

To gain deeper insights into the data, a summary of each dataset is generated, highlighting the data types and the presence of any null values. This information is crucial for identifying potential data quality issues.

**5. Order Count Analysis**

The total order count for each `stock_id` is aggregated and visualized using a bar plot. This analysis helps in understanding the distribution of order counts across different stock IDs, with a specific focus on identifying the stocks with the highest order volumes.

- **Graph**: The bar plot reveals the total order count for each `stock_id`, showcasing the stock IDs with the highest and lowest order volumes.

**6. Group Size Analysis**

Similar to the order count analysis, the total size for each `stock_id` is aggregated and visualized. This step provides insights into the distribution of trade sizes across different stock IDs.

- **Graph**: The bar plot illustrates the total size for each `stock_id`, highlighting the stocks with the largest and smallest trade sizes.

**7. Weighted Average Price (WAP) Calculation**

For a sample of the book data, a new column for the weighted average price (WAP) is added. This step involves calculating the WAP for each record, which is crucial for subsequent volatility analysis.

**8. WAP Analysis**

The changes in WAP over time for `stock_id` 0 are visualized using a line plot. This visualization helps in understanding the temporal dynamics of the weighted average price.

- **Graph**: The line plot displays the fluctuations in WAP over time, segmented by different `time_id` values.

**9. Log Return Calculation**

The log return for each time bucket is calculated and null values are removed. This step is essential for measuring the return volatility, which is a key aspect of financial time series analysis.

**10. Log Return Analysis**

The changes in log return over time for `stock_id` 0 are visualized using a line plot. This analysis provides insights into the volatility of returns over time.

- **Graph**: The line plot shows the variations in log return over time, providing a clear view of return volatility across different `time_id` values.

**11. Realized Volatility Calculation**

The realized volatility for each time bucket is calculated and printed for `stock_id` 0. This step quantifies the actual volatility observed in the market, which is critical for risk management and trading strategies.

**12. Train Data Loading**

The train dataset is loaded from a CSV file, focusing on the first few rows to understand its structure. This dataset contains the realized volatility targets that are used for model training.

**13. Train Data Shape**

The shape of the train dataset is displayed, providing an overview of the dataset's dimensions and the number of records available for training.

**14. Train Data Analysis**

A detailed analysis of the train dataset is conducted by focusing on `stock_id` 0. Histograms are created to visualize the distribution of realized volatility and its logarithmic transformation. This analysis helps in understanding the target variable's distribution and its characteristics.

- **Graph**: The first histogram illustrates the distribution of realized volatility for `stock_id` 0.
- **Graph**: The second histogram shows the distribution of the logarithmic transformation of realized volatility, offering a different perspective on the data.
